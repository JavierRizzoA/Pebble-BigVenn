# Pebble-BigVenn

![Banner](img/banner.png)

A watchface for the Pebble Smartwatch.

Who needs numbers when you can use color and circles?  This colorful (in certain
platforms :-)) watchface uses three rotating circles to show you the hour,
minute and (optionally) seconds.

And of course you can customize the color of each circle!

This watchface was made for the
[Rebble Hackathon #002](https://rebble.io/hackathon-002/).
